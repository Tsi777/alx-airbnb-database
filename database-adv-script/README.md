INNER JOIN: Returns only the records that have matching values in both tables (bookings and users).
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table (properties) and the matched records from the right table (reviews). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for the right table.
FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left (users) or right (bookings) table records. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for missing matches.
